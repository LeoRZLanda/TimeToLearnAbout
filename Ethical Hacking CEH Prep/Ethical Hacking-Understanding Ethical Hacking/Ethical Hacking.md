# Ethical Hacking

The porpuse of this, we can understand this thanks to the next quote.

> If you know the enemy and know yourself, you need not fear the result of a hundred of battles. If yu know yourself but not the enemy, for every vitory gained you will also suffer a defeat. If you know neither the enemy nor yourself, you will succumb in every battle.
> 
\- Sun Tzu, the art of war.
