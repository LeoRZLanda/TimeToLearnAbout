# Classifying Information Security

The porpuse of this, we can understand this thanks to the next quote.

> If you know the enemy and know yourself, you need not fear the result of a hundred of battles. If yu know yourself but not the enemy, for every vitory gained you will also suffer a defeat. If you know neither the enemy nor yourself, you will succumb in every battle.
> 
\- Sun Tzu, the art of war.

## Some interesting Stats

* 65% of companies have over 1,000 stale user accounts

* 92% of ATMs ae vulnerable to hacker attacks

* Ransomware attacks happen every 14 seconds

* 65% of large companies have more than 500 employees who have never changed their passwords

* More than 77% of organizations do not have a cyber security incident response plan



Know all about this stats its obvious to question ourselfs, How secure i fell?

# Understanding the attackers and their Methods

## Hacking Frameworks

When it comes to ethical hacking, is that you need to think like an attacker. So therefore, we need to understand the attackers ant their methods.

And we do that first by looking at what they refer to

### Cyber Kill chain Methodology

This ilustrate us how attacker typically will go after an organization. And because we can predict, what the attacker will do, based of the methodology, what we're going to do next, it helps us in the protection of our resources and networks.


Created by Lockheed Martin and they broke it down into seven different phases, thses phases are intelligent-driven defenses for identification and prevention of attackers and their activities.

It also acts as a _framework for securing cyberspace_ based on the concept of a military kill chain.

These phases are


<details>
	<summary><h4> 1. Reconnaissance </h4></summary>
		<p>
			Is basically where the attacker goes and gathers as much information as they can about their intended victim. </br> </br> And we do this with various tools and resources, publicly available information that's on the internet, for example social media. </br> </br> We're trying to gather information such as network and system information. Normally the target doesn't realize that we're going after them because we're very passive in this step. </br> </br>Some of the activities that an attacker goes through during this stage are: </br> <ul> <li>Look in detail what technologies are the target using on their website.</li> </br> <li>The interface ofr the email you provide a wbe-bases email service for your employees. </li> </br> <li>Looking at whois information.</li> </br> <li>DNS information.</li> </br> <li>Try to footprint the network.</li> </br> <li>scan network to identify open ports and services that you allow.</li> </ul>
		</p>
</details>

<details>
	<summary><h4> 2. Weaponization </h4></summary>
		<p>
			This is the stage where the attacker go through and analyze the information that gathered during the reconnaissance stage, identifying vulnerabilities and techniques that can use to gain remote access or on-premisse, acomplished thanks to create some malicious payloads that´s customized just for the specific environment, target specific devices like operating systems, desktop machines, switches, this is time to start creatng phishing email campaings maybe even a sperfish campaing where going to target specific individuals.
		</p>
</details>

<details>
	<summary><h4> 3. Delivery </h4></summary>
		<p>
			It's like it sounds, time to delivery the payload, it could be delivered either via a;</br> <ul> <li>Link in a phishing email</li> <li>As an email attachment</li> <li>USB Drop </li> </ul>
		</p>
</details>

<details>
	<summary><h4> 4. Exploitation </h4></summary>
		<p>
			So after transmitted to the target the goal is hat somebody actually runs the exploit. </br></br> In this stage the company's security policies face in to kick out the attack beacause aware you abaout not to click external links or attachments, or get trained about authentication and authorization attacks, but if not, the next stage will be.
		</p>
</details>

<details>
	<summary><h4> 5. Installation </h4></summary>
		<p>
			It's time to install that malicious payload, as well as install even more malicious software, including things like; backdoors. Here take action any type of IDS, Intrusion detection system to prevent doing that, obviously hide the backdoors. If the installation get completed of all the aditional tools then we move on to the
		</p>
</details>

<details>
	<summary><h4> 6. Command and control </h4></summary>
		<p>
			Here is time to create a two-way channel between target systems to ours to be able to command and control the systems via the two-way communication to be able to send issue comands that the system responds to or possibly be notified that the system are up online, so we are going to leverage things like privilege escalation meaning  going to up the privilege so we can possibly do more damage or take control over more systems. Obviously hiding the evidence of the compromise using things like encryption.
		</p>
</details>

<details>
	<summary><h4> 7. Action on objectives </h4></summary>
		<p>
			This is where the attacker goes through and starts stealing your confidential information, your customer lists, your databases, your employee record, or mybe start utilizing DoS techniques to affect the environment or using it like a launching point, to perform other attacks.
		</p>
</details>



### Other Frameworks

#### [MITRE ATT&CK](https://attack.mitre.org/)

That it was done in 2013, and it was designed to document the common tactics and techniques as well as procedures, TTP´s,that advanced persistent threats use against Windows enterprise networks.

The why of the ATT&CK technique or subtechnique is what we refer to as a tactic, the adversarial strategic goal, or the reason behind taking a particular action.

To obtain the desire outcome, techniques are the actions an adversary takes.

Procedures are what the adversary does to carry out th techniques or subtechniwues.

Another framework that is qute popular is the

#### Diamond Model of Intrusion Analysis

In this model provides a strucuture for identifying correlated groups of events, or clusters.

Provide a framework for developing a mor efficient method of stopping attacks and increasing analytics productivity. Not only des this save the defender or your money, but it also makes mounting an attack mor expensive for the attackers.

This model consists of four basic features.

<details>
		<summary><h4>1. Adversary </h4></summary>
		<p>A group or an individual that carries out the attack and the attack vector<p>
</details>

<details>
		<summary><h4>2. Capability </h4></summary>
		<p>Referring to all the strategies, the techniques, the procedures associated with the attack<p>
</details>

<details>
		<summary><h4>3. Infrastructure </h4></summary>
		<p>Refers to the physical or virtual components that make up the network, meaning to the systems an adversary could target to gain access<p>
</details>

<details>
		<summary><h4>4. Victim </h4></summary>
		<p>An individual or organization, even a domain or an IP address<p>
</details>

This model was named because when all the features are arranged according to the relationshio between them, it forms a diamond-shaped structure.

## Tactics, Techniques and Procedures (TTP´s)

TTP's refer to basically the activities ad patterns that attackers, or even grup of attacker, will utilize.

Themselves are extremly helpful to us, and looking at threads and profiling attackers.

Lets first start look at:


### Tactics

Are the way that attackers operateduring the different phases of the attack.


If we properly look at the tactics, we are actually able to profile,the ways they gather information, the methods that they typically follow for the initial compromise.


For example, there's some attackers that will depend solely on information that's availabe to them via public information, like the internet. Others might actually use social enginerring techniques, or even maybe pivoting from a third party into the target organization.

So in many cases, understanding the tactics that are used in the last stage of a hackers or attackers will help us to profile that particular individual.

___Anticipate your attacker(s) next move by understanding their tactics.___

Helping us to create an initial profile by understanding the diferent phases of an APT, Advanced Persistent Threat,  lifecycle.


**Warning:** Now, some attackers will actually change their TTPs so they aren´t profile, but those are typically pretty good hackers.

### Techniques

Refers that the attacker typically use specific techniques during their execution. 

These techniques include things like how did they initially do the exploitation?

What was the setup, the maintaining of the C&C, Comand & Control?

The techniques typically followed by an attacker to conduct an attack will sometimes be a little different, but they're mostly very similar to each other, and again, we can still use it profiling..

### Procedures

Basically looking at the sequence of actions that are performed by attackers to gain or achive certain goals throughout their attack lifecycle. 

For example, the basic procedure of gaining information during reconnaissance,an attacker will typically identify the key targets the employees, gather their detailed information, identify vulnerability systems, as well as different attack vectors. 

## Adversary Behavioral Identification

Involves identifying of some of the methods or techniques that attackers used to launch againts therr targeta and give us the insight into what may be coming at us next.

Take look at some of these behaviors

<details>
	<summary><h3>Internal reconnaissance</h3></summary>
	<p>
		If the attacker's able to get inside the network, they're going to follow specific techniques and methods to carry out additional reconnaissance, but instead of being on the outside, they're now on the inside. </br> </br> Once they make it in, we´re going to start enumerating, we're going to discover what systems are operating. </br> </br> <b>Enumeration:</b> </br> <ul> <li>OS</li> <li>Services</li> <li>Appd and versions</li> <li>Hosts</li> <li>Processes</li> <li>User accounts</li> <li>IP addresses</li> <li>Host names</li> </ul> </br>And what we can do as security professionals is by looking for any unusual commands that are executed, typicaly in some type of a script, maybe even PowerShell, and by using packet capturing tools like Wireshark.
	</p>
</details>

<details>
	<summary><h3>PowerShell</h3></summary>
	<p>
		Attackers can use this structure or this technology wich is built into every single version of Windows, since Windows 7 and we now have it in Linux. And the reason why this is a concern, is that Powershell itself, can tell us a <a href="#plethora"> plethora </a> of information that we can pull using PowerShell. We can even execute commands on a remote machine via PowerShell.  </br> </br>So as a security professional, we need to make sure that we monitor and check the transcription logs and the event logs for PowerSell, typically these logs will identify the IP address that's trying to exfiltrate the data itself, so that would help you in determining where it's coming from. </br> </br> <p id = "plethora"><b>Plethora:</b></br>A very large amount or number: an amount that is much greater than necessary</br><small>-"Plethora", <a href = "https://www.merriam-webster.com/dictionary/plethora.">Merriam-Webster Dictionary</a> </small></p> 
	</p>
</details>

<details>
	<summary><h3>CLI processes</h3></summary>
	<p>
		Attackers are going to use the command line interface 98% of the time to interact with the target, to browse files, to gain access or to look at content, to create new accounts. So similar of PowerShell, we're going to make sure that we are checking logs for process IDs, any processes that have arbitrary letters and numbers in them. Any files that were download off the internet could also be a clue.
	</p>
</details>

<details>
	<summary><h3>Suspicious proxy events</h3></summary>
	<p>
		One of the cool things that attackers love to do is we like to create and configure multiple domains that actually point to the exact same host, it actually allows the attacker to move quickly between domains to avoid detection, or switch these domains. </br> </br> Our job is to look for unspecified domains by, checking our data feed that are gathered by those domains.
	</p>
</details>

<details>
	<summary><h3>HTTP User Agent</h3></summary>
	<p>
		HTTP base communications use what we refer to as user agent field,  attackers can modify the content of the HTTP user agent field to communicate, using C&C we'll trying to comunicate to our compromised systems to control the systems that we've compromised already. </br> </br> How a professional, you need to identify this attack at the initial stage by checking the cintent of the user agent field.
	</p>
</details>

<details>
	<summary><h3>C&C Servers</h3></summary>
	<p>
		C&C allows attackers to issue commands to hundreds of systems with one entry. </br> </br> In order to use C&C environment, we're going to use an encrypted channel, and we use that to also steal data, delete information, and anything else we find we want to do. </br> </br>Professionals can detect compromised hosts by tracking ntwork traffic for outbound connection attempts or unwanted ports that are opening up.  
	</p>
</details>

<details>
	<summary><h3>DNS Tunneling</h3></summary>
	<p>
		  As usual when we wan to visit som web place we type a DNS name, instead of a IP, so and that whole DNS nae resolution takes place. Attackers can actually use DNS to tunnel and hide any malicious traffic. </br> </br> Using DNS tunneling, we can also comunicate with: </br> </br> <ul> <li>Talk with C&C's</li> <li>Bypass security controls</li> <li> Monitor requests </li> <li>DNS Payloads</li> <li> Destinations </li> </ul>
	</p>
</details>

<details>
	<summary><h3>Web-Shells</h3></summary>
	<p>
		  Attackers can use web shells to control web servers by creating a shell whitin the website itself, and just start typing away any typ of commands. Used by transferd/upload files. So you need to be looking at any web shells that mey be runnning on your servers. Look at the error logs, as well and possibly any bizzare-looking strings in your requests.
	</p>
</details>

<details>
	<summary><h3>Data-Staging</h3></summary>
	<p>
		  After we've gained access, i'm going to take the data that i'm looking for and I´m going to stage it up sommeplace fo transmission. Information I'm going to gather are going to be things, like business tactis that your rganization follows, financial information, network infrastructure information and put it in a single location, maybe like an FTP site that I've created or just starting to destroy the data.
	</p>
</details>

## Indicators of Compromise (IoC)

Reason of a constant evolution and creation of new threads and TTP's we need to male sure that we moitor different types of indicators of compromise. It's important to understand that **IoC's are not inteligence**, is rather an IoC is a good source of information about the thread that serves as data points for intelligence.

Take a look at some of teh IoC's that you'll wnant to be aware of:

* Unauthorized software and files

* Suspicious emails

* Suspicious registry nd fil system changes

* unknown ports and protocol usage

* Excessive bandwith usage

* Rogue hardware

* Service disruption and defacement

* Suspicious or unauthorized account usage (like Sharepoint, Exchange, ISS, SQL, etc)

All of these indicators e need to be looking at not only at a host-based level but also at network level.

Network indicators are extremly useful when it comes to looking for those C&C indicators.

# Comparing Hacking and Ethical Hacking
Its important to know the deference between hacking and ethical hacking.

## Hacking Concepts

### What is Hacking?

>Hacking is exploiting security controls either in a technical, physical or a human-based element
>
>-Kevin Mitnick

* Exploiting systems and their vulnerabilities
* Modifying systems and/or applications
* Steal intellectual property (Thats the only thing to transoform hacking ino a "evil" thing)

___Hacking isn't always nefarious___

### Types of hackers

|Hackers|Definition|
| - | - |
|Black Hat|The evil ones|
|White Hat|The hero one|
|Gray Hats|A reformed Black hat </br>Their ethics are questionable|
|Suicide Hacker|Carefree</br>The mission is the only thing that matters</br>Don't care about covering their tracks|
|Script Kiddies|Clueless about hacking|
|Spy hackers, Cyber terrorists and state-sponsored hackers|Organized crime and big corporations </br>Driven by political or religious agendas|


The duference between a spy hacker and a government-sponsored hacker is that the spy hacker gets a payckeck from a rival business to steal intellectual property, while the state-sponsored hacker gets paid by the government or government agency. State-sponsored hacking makes it possible for states to get a hold of secrets from other countries,military organizations, multinational companies and organizations.




### Who's a Hacker?

___Anybody can be___

* A excellent computer skills
* Hobbyist
* Curious

### Hacktivism


<details>
	<summary>Drive</summary>
	<p>
	Is an individual attacker , as well as posibly a group and their drives include political, social, ideology, as well as vandalism, protesting, and to humiliate.
	</p>
</details>

<details>
	<summary>Political Agenda</summary>
	<p>

### Hacking

Exploiting a systems vulnerabilities and security controls to gain access to system resources and features, outside the creator's original purpose.


## Hacking cycle

### Phase 1: Reconnaissance

Technically, it's the most time-consuming pahse for attackers. Because the payoff is massive.


In the future I will take a full course of Ethical Hacking: Reconnaissance /Footprinting


Now, we can accomplish reconnaissance in two ways

* Pasive
	* No direct interaction with the target
	* Research the company
	
* Active
	* Direct interaction with the target
	* Engage and scans the network

Most of the time attackers won't do active reconnaissance unless they're pretty positive that the're goin to be discovered by their actions. 

A type of reconnaissance that's passive and a little active depends on how we do it.

#### Social Engineering

Same as beafore i will insert a link to another course aboy Ethical Hacking: Social Enginering.

___Masketers and advertisers are masters at social engineering___


### Phase 2: Scanning

This is where tech attacker goes throgh and tries to gather

Appassive technique would be just a sniffing, seeling that gaus.


he information that we can gather include like thr system:

+ ID Systems
+ Vulnerabilitid

Gather Info

Tools /Interface
* Port scanners
* Vulnerability scannets.

### Phase 3: Gaining Access

Mean that the attacker is able to gain acces to a network or an operating system or even applications.

What's interesting is that attackers can create a lot of havoc for you without gaining access, through things like denial of service attacks. 

So some of the goals that are involved when we try yo gain access includes:

* Access data
* Reconfigure or crash a system
* Exhaust the resource

As far as the path of gaining access, that can include doing it over the land or through the internet, and then we strat doing things like password cracking and buffer overflows, session hijacks, even DoS.

Once we're able to gain access to a system, we start trying to escalate the privileges so that we can increase our footprint either by pivoting to other systems or just creating more havoc for you.

### Phase 4: Maintaining Access

Once we gain access, we then want to try yo maintaining access, and we di that through a cuople of different methods.

First we're going to hide our tools that we utilize using things like rootkits.


* PWNing the system

* Use system as a launch pad

* Inject backdoor/trojans
	* Used to revisit
	* Used to sniff/monitor network

* Use resources

* Harden up

### Phase 5: Clearing Tracks

Clearing the tracks is the fifth nd last stage of an attack. After getting into the system or getting it to do what they want, the next move is to cover their tracks. 

Leave the place as neat or as clean as they found it or even better.

Remember "These are not the drones that you were looking for"

* <details>
	<summary>Destroy proof</summary>
	<p>Most attacker are going to get rid of their own log entries so there's no proof of them destroying anything. We do taht by clearing log files. </br> </br>And in the real world, most IT individuals, aren't looking at log files on a daily basis. They only look at thme when something seems weird,and by that point, I've already deleted my entries</p>
</details>

* <details>
	<summary>Hide my stuff</summary>
	<p>The next thing i'm going to is to install some type of root kit to hide my tools. We could also use things like stenography to hide our information.</p>
</details>

* <details>
	<summary>Cyber blind</summary>
	<p>And we will also want to set up a cyber blind, so you don't see anything that I'm doing, but 'm laying in wait for an ambush </p>

## So What's Ethical Hacking?

So now we know about hacking, what about ethicla hacking?, It's exact the same process except for you have permission to od it.

Involves the use of hacking methods and tools to dicover weaknesses for security system.

Is commonly use as a penetration test to identify vulnerabilities, risks and identify loopholes in those systems.

What skills should an ethical Hacker have?

* Expert with programs and networks
 
* Proficient with vulnerability research
 
* Mastery with diverse hacking techniques
 
* Follow a strict code of conduct
 
* Explicit permissions in writting
 
* Use the same tactics and strategies
 
* Just because you can, doesn't mean you can

* Report all of your results


In few words, ethical hacking is the practice to guard sensitive data from attackers.


## Lets talk about Labs

Trough this course we complish activities, dont worry i will try to learn you step by step during the lab activities.

Or you can follow to learn how to Build your own virtual hacking lab to make the activities

## Learning Check

So we went through and talked about the different classes of hackers that are out there.

Wich one is described as an individual who's going to do anything they can to bring down a target regardless of anny consequence?


<details>
	<summary>Answer</summary>
	<p>Suicide Hacker</p>
</details>

What avout an individual who fluctuates between the good side and the dark side?

<details>
	<summary>Answer</summary>
	<p>Gray Hat</p>
</details>

What avout an individual that's really no all together a hacker, but finds a bunch of cool tools and tries to go at you.

<details>
	<summary>Answer</summary>
	<p>Script kiddies</p>
</details>

And then we have individuals that have really, really good skills, as well as malicious purposes or malicious intent that are involved in malicious activities

<details>
	<summary>Answer</summary>
	<p>Black Hat</p>
</details>

What about an attacker that hacks to increase awareness of their social or political agenda, don't care if they caught?

<details>
	<summary>Answer</summary>
	<p>Hacktivist</p>
</details>


We the went through and talked about the diferent phases of an attack, so let's test our knowledge there.

The first stateg was actually reconnaissace, and there were two different types.

If a was just to go find some public records or look at your website, what type of reconnaissance would that be?

<details>
	<summary>Answer</summary>
	<p>Passive</p>
</details>

And if i have direct interaction with the target, what is that?

<details>
	<summary>Answer</summary>
	<p>Active</p>
</details>


Now, if an attacker doesn't want to be discovered or tracked after they maintin access, what's the next phase?

<details>
	<summary>Answer</summary>
	<p>Clearing tracks</p>
</details>

What would be the phase be if I installed a rootkit or a back door of some sort?

<details>
	<summary>Answer</summary>
	<p>Maintaining access</p>
</details>

What phase does an attacker escale their provilege?

<details>
	<summary>Answer</summary>
	<p>Gaining Access</p>
</details>

# Describing Information Security Controls

## Understanding the Attackers and their methods

What we wnt to focus on right here is the information security controls.


>I don't even call it violence when it's self-defense, i call it intelligence.
>
>-Malcom X

And that's the whole concept when we look at information security tools. They are designed to help to protect or networks or the network we're evaluating.


___Rapid Growth in Tech = Trouble___

When we have a rapid pace in technology it adds to complexity and his combination create issues ofr us.

### What Ethical Hacker Do

* Review systems and infrastructure
* Test current security
* Create solutions


We typically also need to be aware of both the <a href="#scope">scope</a> 

The scope of the ethical hacking is part of our risk assessment, auditing, as well as fraud.

There's also best practices that we can show them, possibly even <a href="#scope">governance</a>, As far as limitations are concerned with ethical hacking, typically, businesses really don't know what they're looking for, and tehy don't know that they have a problem until it's too late.

Your job is to help the understand why they need this particular solution. And then afterwards, we retest to make sure that the things we've suggested and that they've implemented are actually working correctly. And able to answer questions like;

* What can be seen?
* What is being monitored?
* What can be done?
* Is there adequate protection?
* Are compliances met


<p id = "scope"> <b>Scope:</b> assests, networks and systems that can be targeted, and the limitations.</p>

<p id = "governance"> <b>Governance:</b> assests, networks and systems that can be targeted, and the limitations.</p>

So it is necessary?

Is the fact that attackers are continally changig up and figuring out new mechanisms tacking advantages of new technologues that come out almost daily. There has to be someody that we can call or that can help us to counter these type of attacks.

So yes, **Ethical hacking is necessary**.



## What is "Defene in Depth"?

Is that we're trying to manage the risk with diferent types of strategies.  And what this does for us is it allows us if one layer fails, another layer automatically kicks in. **Remeber our job is to slow attackers down**.

It doesn't matter how many layers of security you have. Each leayer, you have to assume each one is the last stand. As you implement different devces throughout your infraestrucure, you need to have in your mindset what happens if the attacker get past this?, Whats next?.

Now, there's an unfortunate side here, and there's a ton of software out there that's been designed or maybe even customized to applications that you may be writting ypur organization that leads to a total compromis when the firewall gets breached.

That's not good enough. Just beacuse some defense mechanism have been compromised doesn't give you the right to simply put the white flag and surrender, and that is the essence of defense in depth. At some stage, you're going to be left alone, and you have to defend yourself.


> Gentlemen. prepare to defend yourselves!
> 
> -Sergeant Major Plumley (We Were Soldiers 2002)


## The levels of Defense in Depth

We typically first start of with:

<ol>
	<li>
		<details>
			<summary>Policies, Processes and Awarness</summary></br>
			<p>This is where we have things like password policies, data classification, policies on what is mission critical and what's not.</p>
		</details>
	</li>
	<li>
		<details>
			<summary>Physical</summary></br>
			<p>This is physical restrictions like locks, fences, security guards, CAC cards, biometrics, even cameras. </p>
		</details>
	</li>
	<li>
		<details>
			<summary>Perimeter</summary></br>
			<p>This is where we're looking at our firewall solutions, <a href="#vpn">VPN</a> solutions, packet filters, <a href="#ids">IDS</a> systems, anything that we place on the perimeter of our network, the perimeter being that area betwwen us and the internet, we also refer to like a <a href="#dmz">DMZ</a> area.</p>
		</details>
	</li>
	<li>
		<details>
			<summary>Network</summary></br>
			<p>The internal network, firewalls are going to be implemented here again sames like IDS, routers, diferent solutions for encryption.</p>
		</details>
	</li>
	<li>
		<details>
			<summary>Host</summary></br>
			<p>Here we're watching operating systems, patching those systems, difetent types of malware protection, those endpoints.</p>
		</details>
	</li>
	<li>
		<details>
			<summary>Application</summary></br>
			<p>Are we using authentication?, what are we using authorization, What are we usng for <a href="#sso">SSO</a>?, How are the application being patched, maintained, managed? I fwe have any sensitive application secrets, where are those actually stores?</p>
		</details>
	</li>
	<li>
		<details>
			<summary>Data</summary></br>
			<p>Where are we storing tha database?, stored in virtual machines, out in the cloud, locally? stored i a <a href="saas">SaaS</a> application?, we may also want to include encryption at this level as well</p>
		</details>
	</li>
</ol>


A couple of things that we need to consider when it comes to these diferent layers in our defesnse in depth strategy.

Consider This

* <details>
	<summary>Never ignore the edge</summary>
	<p>Just because we have these other lines of defenses behind us deeper wiyhin our infrastrucutre, doesn't mean that we should ignore the edge. The edge is where we want to stop the breach from.</p>
</details>

* <details>
	<summary>Follow the workflow</summary>
	<p>To determine your protection points.</p>
</details>

* <details>
	<summary>Zero Trust Security posture</summary>
	<p>And as final option, consider a zero trust security posture, these types of mechanisms are implemented in a default mode, where there is no connectivity allowed and less credentials have been validated.</p>
</details>

### Terminology

<p id="vpn"><b>VPN:</b> Virtual private network</p>

<p id="ids"><b>IDS:</b> Intrusion Detection System</p>

<p id="dmz"><b>DMZ:</b> Demilitarized zone</p>

<p id="soo"><b>SOO:</b> Single Sign On</p>

<p id="saas"><b>SaaS:</b> Software as a Service</p>

## What Is the Risk?

The risk refers to the degree of uncertaintly or expectation that an event might cause damage to our systems. 

Risk = Threats X Vulnerabilities X Impact

<div class = "container">
	<div>
		<p class = "RL"><b>Risk Levels</b></p>
		<table class = "Risk-Levels">
			<tr>
				<th>Level</th>
				<th>Consequence</th>
				<th>Action</th>
			</tr>
			<tr>
				<td>Extreme / High</td>
				<td>Serious</td>
				<td>Immediate action is required</td>
			</tr>
			<tr>
				<td>Medium</td>
				<td>Moderate</td>
				<td>Action should be prioritized</td>
			</tr>
			<tr>
				<td>Level</td>
				<td>Consequence</td>
				<td>Action</td>
			</tr>
			<tr>
				<td>Low</td>
				<td>Negligible</td>
				<td>Preventive steps</td>
			</tr>
		</table>
		</br>
		<p>
			The risk level is simply an assessment of the result of the impact on your network, and the risks are categorized into different level. Now you have to remeber that control measures may decrease at the level of risk, but don't always eliminate the risk.
		</p>
		</br>
	</div>
	<div align = "center">
		<p class = "RL"><b>Risk Levels</b></p>
		<img src="../../Ethical Hacking CEH Prep/Ethical Hacking-Understanding Ethical Hacking/assets/Risk-matrix.svg" width="620" height="148" alt="css-in-readme">
	</div>
	</br>
		<p>
			We also have the Risk Matrix, defines various levels of risks and then categorizes them for us as the product of negative probability and the negativity of severity. As far as your future is concerned, you won't see anything specific on the exam for these matrix and levels.
		</p>
		</br>
</div>

Be careful, when a breach happens, it's very easy to lose track of what is significant.


## Threat Modeling

Is simply risk assessment approach for looking at the security of applications, And we do this by capturing, organizing and analyzing all the data that affects those applcations.

### Threat Modeling Adversary Capability

The purpouse behind threat modeling helps us to;

* Identify threats
* Identify vulnerabilities
* Improve your security designs


Now when you use threat modeling, you need to be careful that you keep the following in mind 

### Things to Keep in Mind

* Try not to be to rigid about specific steps.
</br>
* Focus on the approach.
</br>
* Use existing design documents that you have access to. <small>Any type of documented use cases or use stories can help you out.</small>
</br>
* Start with white boarding before capturing information in those documents or getting lost in all the details that you're going to come across.
</br>


Now threat modeling itself, the process, involves a couple of different steps for us.


### Adversary Capability

## Incident Management


### Think Outside the Box


We need to come up with some preocesses to help us out to 

1. Identify
2. Analyze
3. Prioritize
4. Resolve

Part of ifguring out our incident management procedure is coming up with the... 

### The "Why" of Incident Management

* Meets availability
* Reduces impact
* Better service quality
* More efficient and productive
* Customer/User satisfaction
* Proactive

## The Incident Handling and Response (IH&R)

### IH&R Process

Basically involves defining diferent;

* policies
* protocols
* building an incident response team
* Auditing assets
* planning inidents

#### Steps

<ol>
	<li>
		<details>
			<summary>Prepare for Event Handling and Reaction</summary>
			<p></br>Meaning we're going to perform and audit of the resources, the assets to determine the purpose of the security rules and policies that help to drive the process itself.</p></br>
		</details>
	</li>
	<li>
		<details>
			<summary>Incident Recording and Assigment</summary>
			<p></br>Basically this is the initial reporting recording of the fact that an incident has taken place. We're going to go through and identify the incident, the proper identification communication plans for employees who may be involved, possibly also the communication methods for all the employees, depending on how widespread that breach is, the we do the</p></br>
		</details>
	</li>
	<li>
		<details>
			<summary>Triage</summary>
			<p></br>This helps us to identify the security incidents that are analyzed. We're going to go through and further analyze th compromised deviced, see if we can find any information such as:<ul><li>Type of attack</li><li>Its severity</li><li>The target</li><li>The impact</li><li>Vulnerabilities were used</li></ul></p></br>
		</details>
	</li>
	<li>
		<details>
			<summary>Notification</summary>
			<p></br>This is where our IH&R team will inform all the stakeholders and maybe including; <ul><li>Upper management</li><li>Marketing, if somebody needs to do a press release</li><li>Any third-party vendors</li><li>Clients that may be part of the incident</li></ul></p></br>
		</details>
	</li>
	<li>
		<details>
			<summary>Containment</summary>
			<p></br>This is going to help prevent the spread of the incident into other assets. It doesn't necessarily mean that we pull the plug, but we do want t contain it as much as we can, because of the next step, </p></br>
		</details>
	</li>
	<li>
		<details>
			<summary>Forensic Examination</summary>
			<p></br>This is where we're going to going to go through and look at all possibe evidence that's related to the incident,and then we're going to submit that to the forensic department. Sometimes, the forensic department wants to see the system as it's running. That's why that containment, we don't just pull the plug.</p></br>
		</details>
	</li>
	<li>
		<details>
			<summary>Eradication</summary>
			<p></br>This is where we remove or eliminate the root cause and then close all the attack vectors to stop further or a future incident from taking place.</p></br>
		</details>
	</li>
	<li>
		<details>
			<summary>recovery</summary>
			<p></br>After we get rid of the causes, we then start restoring any of the assets, the systems, the data, services.</p></br>
		</details>
	</li>
	<li>
		<details>
			<summary>Post-incident Acions</summary>
			<p></br>We're going to condict a final review of the lessons we learned or important steps that we discovered. this process will inlude all of our documentation, our assessments, any updates to policies that we have, and then the disclosure of the incident.</p></br>
		</details>
	</li>
</ol>

## The role of AI/ML

When it comes to IA, there are several cyberscurity companie out there using AI to actually send aletrs or raise alerts to you when something has happened to you or when you start to see malware, botnets, new exploits popping up on you, including things like users and how they're handling data.

Then of talking about IA lets start of machine learning, is kind of a branch of IA.  It's what allows the system the ability to slef learn without any explicit programming. 

The cibersecurity sector is \#4 in this AI environment, there are over 80 private companies in cybersecurity that are using AI, and they're categorizing them into nine main areas that they operate.

1. Mobile security
2. Inthernet of Things
3. Internet of Threats
4. Behavior Analysis

Amoung other fun things.

Now as far as certification  concerned with CEH, they just want you to be aware of artificial intelligence and machine learning, not necessarily how to do it beacause it's still a baby in its evolution.

## Can AI and ML Stop Attacks?

Well, they're doing quite a bit already, and again, this is an emerging technologyso it's changing all the tima, but they are actually helping in:

# Differentiate Information Security Laws and Standars

I think it's probably important here to note that there is a difference between the law and a standard or a guideline.

A standard is just simply a document that is established, typically by consensus, and is approved by a boyd that is recognized by that particular industry, and it provides common rules, as well as guidelines and activities for their particular environment.

## The basics

### The standard for credit card processing

**Payment Card Industry Data Security Standard (PCI DSS)**

How his name say to us, a standard in order to accept credit cards. And those are going to include things like being able to prove that you;

<details>
	<summary>Build and maintain a secure network</summary></br>
	<p>Including things like firewall configurtions in place to protect cardholder data. Obviuosly don't using defaults settings, specially for system passwords.</p></br>
</details>

<details>
	<summary>Protect carholder data</summary></br>
	<p>Meaning that we're going to encrypt it while it's in motion or even in storage.</p></br>
</details>

<details>
	<summary>Maintain a VMP</summary></br>
	<p>A Vulnerability Management Program, showing that you use and regularly update your antivirus as well as your programs that are involved in any system that is involved in the credit card process.</p></br>
</details>

<details>
	<summary>Strong acces controls</summary></br>
	<p>We're going to restrict access to cardholder information so that the business doesn't get everything. They only that's need to know for that business is transmitted or actuakky received by that business. We'll also go through in assign unique IDs to each person with computer access, and we're going to restrict physical access to any of the cardholder information that the company is storing.</p></br>
</details>

<details>
	<summary>Monitor and test</summary></br>
	<p>We also have being able to prove that we regularly monitor and test our netwoks, and of course we're going to update those at any time.</p></br>
</details>

<details>
	<summary>nformation security policy</summary></br>
	<p>We´re going to have a policy in place, maintain it, update it for anybody that's involved in the process of handling any type of credit card information.   </p></br>
</details>


### ISO/IEC 27001:2013

We also have something that specifes the requirements for information security;

✔ Implement
✔ Maintain
✔ Establish
✔ Improve

So we're going to make sure that we stablish;

* Security requirements and goals
* Cost-effective
* Compliance
* New and existing InfoSec processes
* Status of InfoSec activities
* Provide InfoSec information to customers


### Health Insurance Portability and Accountability Act (HIPAA)

Actually provides federal protection for any individual's health information maintained or stored by any type of health company.

And they've laid out several different rles for administrative, physical and technical safeguards and they include things like;

<details>
	<summary>Electronic transaction and code set standars</summary></br>
	<p> Any transacton, including health claims, payment, remittance, claim status, authorizations, payments have to be secured. Wether it's in motion or in storage or at rest.</p></br>
</details>

<details>
	<summary>Privacy rule</summary></br>
	<p>This actually establishes another standard to protect people's medical records and other personal health information, including who the healthcare provider is, what the health plan is, All this information has to be secure, as well as, it gve us, the patient, the right for use to control our health information. Includign the right to llok at and actually get a copy of our health records.</p></br>
</details>

<details>
	<summary>Security rule</summary></br>
	<p>This rule requires appropriate physical, technical safeguards, administatuve safeguards to make sure that we have that CIA, Confidentiality, Integrity and  Authorization of electronic protected health information.</p></br>
</details>

<details>
	<summary>National Identifier</summary></br>
	<p>This is basically setting that each employer has a national number that identifies them on all of the different transactions that may take place.</p></br>
</details>

<details>
	<summary>Enforcement rule</summary></br>
	<p>This is going to contain provisionsrelated to any type of compliance, as well as investigations, as well as the possibility of imposing penalties for  vaiolations of any HIPAA rules.</p></br>
</details>

### Sarbanes-Oxley (SOX)

Was created in 2002 to help protect public and investors by adding additional accuracy and reliability when it comes to corporate disclosures.

Now unfortunately, this act doesn't go through and tell the organization how they store the records, butinstead it describes the recirds that the organization must store and how long they storm for.

Now, the key requirement for SOX, are actually organized into several different titles.

<ol>
	<li>
		<details>
			<summary>Public Company Accounting Oversight Board (PCAOB)</summary></br>
			<p>Wich creates a central oversight board tasked with going through and making sure audits are performed, as well as helping us to handle quality control.</p></br>
		</details>
	</li>
	<li>
